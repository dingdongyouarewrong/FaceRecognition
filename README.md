# FaceRecognition
Face recognition system based on the vgg face model's weights. 
U just need to add weights from the vgg face network in the weigths folder, and ur pic 1 and pic 2 in the images folder
(now there is example photo and descriptors). Run saveDescriptors.py if u need to save descriptors of faces in 1st and 2nd pics, then run findFaces.py to use descriptors and find faces.
U can download keras formatted weights here https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Br_zbtdxcnTMeK0Xsx34o9Ywje42gTdn
